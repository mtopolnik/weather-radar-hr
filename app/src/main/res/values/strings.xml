        Double-tap an image to focus on it. Use the seek bar to manually
        control the shown frame. You can pinch-zoom the image. To get back,
        double-tap again or press the Android Back-button.
        \n
        \nPlace the app\'s widget on your home screen to have quick access to
        the current radar image.
        \n
        \nTap the widget image to start the app.
        \n
        \nThe app uses OCR to read the image\'s timestamp, translates it to your
        timezone, and shows it above the image. Sometimes the websites stop
        updating their images, in that case you\'ll see the image\'s age growing.
        Once the age reaches one hour, the text turns red to alert you that the
        image is no longer up-to-date.
        \n
        \nThe app is very conservative with internet traffic usage and never has
        to fetch the same image twice, but you always get the latest images thanks
        to the If-Modified-Since HTTP headers. Owing to this, sometimes an image
        refresh takes just fraction of a second, but you can rest assured that we
        contacted the server and it replied that you already have the latest image.
        If we can\'t contact a server, the title above its image will say “Offline”.
